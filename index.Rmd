# styler Addin

{styler} is an R package that formats your code according to the [tidyverse style
guide](https://style.tidyverse.org) in a non-invasive and safe way

# Hello Addin


A few simple files to create additional functionality within the RStudio Environment.

```{r, out.width = "1000px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("oR4Uus.gif")
```

* You can map this Addin to a shorcut/hot key.

**Objective**

Tools to facilitate logging in a clinical environment to make code easily traceable and reproducible.

**Notable Highlights**

Built around the concept of creating a log for the execution of an R script that provides an overview of what happened as well as the environment that it happened in.

Built with Clinical Reporting Environment in mind.

All code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/atorus-research/timber) and [upcoming vignettes and walk-throughs](https://atorus-research.github.io/timber/) on accompanying site.
